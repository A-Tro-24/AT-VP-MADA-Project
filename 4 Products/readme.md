All the files in this subfolder can be found in the `Figures` folder.

The `Figures` folder contains:
      *`Model_Eval1.pdf`: a scatterplot demonstrating the observed number of COVID deaths
      compared to the main effects model's prediction of COVID deaths by county in Georgia
      *`Model_Eval2.pdf`: a scatterplot demonstrating the observed number of COVID deaths
      compared to the saturated model's prediction of COVID deaths by county in Georgia
      *`Model_Eval3.pdf`: a scatterplot demonstrating the observed number of COVID deaths 
      compared to the residuals from the main effects model. The blue lines represent 2 standard
      deviations away from the mean difference (assuming the mean difference is centered at 0)
      *`Model_Eval4.pdf`: a scatterplot demonstrating the observed number of COVID deaths
      compared to the residuals from the saturated model. The blue lines represent 2 standard
      deviations away from the mean difference (assuming the mean difference is centered at 0)
      *`Mod_Effect_PCI.pdf`: a scatterplot comparing the observed COVID deaths 
      by log per capita income and a trendline showing the model's predictions
      *`Mod_Effect_HC.pdf`: a scatterplot comparing the observed number of COVID deaths 
      by the total number of hospital beds and a trendline showing the model's predictions
      *`Mod_Effect_Grad.pdf`: a scatterplot showing the observed number of COVID deaths
      by the number of hish school graduates and a trendline showing the model's predictions
