   abstract = {Importance: Descriptive data have revealed significant racial/ethnic disparities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the US, but underlying mechanisms of disparities remain unknown. Objective: To examine the association between county-level sociodemographic risk factors and US COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed the association between US county-level sociodemographic risk factors and COVID-19 incidence using mixed-effects negative binomial regression, and COVID-19 mortality using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Data on COVID-19 incidence and mortality were collected from January 20 to July 29, 2020. The association of social risk factors with weekly cumulative incidence and mortality was also examined by interacting time with the index measures, using a random intercept to account for repeated measures. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sociodemographic data from publicly available data sets, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), which includes subindices of socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, racial/ethnic minority and English language proficiency status, and housing and transportation. Results: As of July 29, 2020, there were a total of 4289283 COVID-19 cases and 147074 COVID-19 deaths in the US. An increase of 0.1 point in SVI score was associated with a 14.3% increase in incidence rate (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.16; P <.001) and 13.7% increase in mortality rate (IRR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.12-1.16; P <.001), or an excess of 87 COVID-19 cases and 3 COVID-19 deaths per 100000 population for a SVI score change from 0.5 to 0.6 in a midsize metropolitan county; subindices were also associated with both outcomes. A 0.1-point increase in the overall SVI was associated with a 0.9% increase in weekly cumulative increase in incidence rate (IRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01; P <.001) and 0.5% increase in mortality rate (IRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, a wide range of sociodemographic risk factors, including socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic minority status, household composition, and environmental factors, were significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality. To address inequities in the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, these social vulnerabilities and their root causes must be addressed.},

@article{Jahangiri2020,
   abstract = {On 10 April 2020, Iran reported 68,192 COVID-19 cumulative cases including 4232 death and 35,465 recovery cases. Numerous factors could influence the transmission rate and survival of coronavirus. On this basis and according to the latest epidemiological researches, both ambient temperature (AT) and population size (PS) can be considered as significant transmissibility factors for coronavirus. The analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix. This study intends to investigate the sensitivity of AT and PS on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of Iran. For this purpose, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed. The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively. Thus, there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of COVID-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates. Therefore, it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy.},

   abstract = {It is recognized that novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated from China and quickly crossed all borders by infecting individuals of all age categories throughout the entire world. Since March 11, 2020, the day the novel COVID-19 outbreak was declaration by the WHO as a COVID-19 pandemic, it has caused substantial morbidity and mortality globally. It has become a priority of global society because of the severe impact it puts in all dimensions. Therefore, the present review was intended to examine the knowledge, attitude, practice, and associated factors towards COVID-19. The review addressed the vital points for the health professionals giving care for COVID-19 patients, stakeholders participating on this pandemic virus, health policy-makers and implementers, researchers, and for the populations as a whole. The majority of the studies reflect a good knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice towards COVID-19 respective to their countries. Some studies have identified factors associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding COVID-19. For instance, age, educational level, residence, monthly income, profession, gender, marital status, and news media were factors significantly associated with knowledge. Age, occupation, educational level, monthly income, gender, residence, knowledge, and practice were factors significantly associated with attitude. Age, marital status, educational level, residence, monthly income, knowledge, gender, and attitude were factors significantly associated with practice. The majority of the studies reported a good level of knowledge, optimistic attitude, and a good level of practice about COVID-19. But, some studies showed unimpressive knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19. An improvement is needed, and community education should take place as usual with a commitment by using all the strategies that could support improving the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the population. Training should be provided for healthcare workers to update and make them more effective in diagnosing, managing, and controlling this pandemic. The integration of good knowledge, a positive attitude, and sufficient practice towards COVID- 19 could contribute a significant and essential role in controlling this pandemic.},

   abstract = {Importance: It is now established that across the United States, minoritized populations have borne a disproportionate burden from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, little is known about the interaction among a county's racial/ethnic composition, its level of income inequality, political factors, and COVID-19 outcomes in the population. Objective: To quantify the association of economic inequality, racial/ethnic composition, political factors, and state health care policy with the incidence and mortality burden associated with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the 3142 counties in the 50 US states and for Washington, DC. Data on the first 200 days of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the first confirmed US case on January 22 to August 8, 2020, were gathered from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and USAFacts.org, the US Census Bureau, the American Community Survey, GitHub, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Council of State Governments, and the National Governors Association. Exposures: Racial/ethnic composition was determined as percentage of the population that is Black or Hispanic; income inequality, using the Gini index; politics, political affiliation and sex of the state governor, gubernatorial term limits, and percentage of the county's population that voted Republican in 2016; and state health care policy, participation in the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Six additional covariates were assessed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates for US counties during the first 200 days of the pandemic. Main measures include percentage Black and Hispanic population composition, income inequality, and a set of additional covariates. Results: This study included 3141 of 3142 US counties. The mean Black population was 9.365% (range, 0-86.593%); the mean Hispanic population was 9.754% (range, 0.648%-96.353%); the mean Gini ratio was 44.538 (range, 25.670-66.470); the proportion of counties within states that implemented Medicaid expansion was 0.577 (range, 0-1); the mean number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100000 population was 1093.882 (range, 0-14019.852); and the mean number of COVID-19-related deaths per 100000 population was 26.173 (range, 0-413.858). A 1.0% increase in a county's income inequality corresponded to an adjusted risk ratio (RR) of 1.020 (95% CI, 1.012-1.027) for COVID-19 incidence and adjusted RR of 1.030 (95% CI, 1.012-1.047) for COVID-19 mortality. Inequality compounded the association of racial/ethnic composition through interaction, with higher income inequality raising the intercepts of the incidence curve RR by a factor of 1.041 (95% CI, 1.031-1.051) and that of the mortality curve RR by a factor of 1.068 (95% CI, 1.042-1.094) but slightly lowering their curvatures, especially for Hispanic composition. When state-level specificities were controlled, none of the state political factors were associated with COVID-19 incidence or mortality. However, a county in a state with Medicaid expansion implemented would see the incidence rate RR decreased by a multiplicative factor of 0.678 (95% CI, 0.501-0.918). Conclusions and Relevance: This county-level ecological analysis suggests that COVID-19 surveillance systems should account for county-level income inequality to better understand the social patterning of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. High levels of income inequality may harm population health irrespective of racial/ethnic composition.},
